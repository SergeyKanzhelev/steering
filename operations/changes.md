# Changes to the Steering Committee

At any time, a steering committee member may propose a governance change for
how the committee itself operates (e.g. charter, election process, etc.).  
This should be used sparingly, if ever, and in the presence of clear failures
of the existing process. This process is intended to cover significant changes
versus small tweaks.  The steering committee does not allocate a role for
the broader community in reformulating governance.  The steering committee believes
that in the presence of clear failures, the community will "vote with their feet"
by either leaving or forking the project.

To propose a change, the following process shall be followed:

* Post a pull request to this repository describing the change.
* Send a notice to steering@k8s.io announcing the proposed change.
* If there is no protest after 4 weeks, the change is accepted.
* At any time prior to acceptance, a steering committee member may call a vote.
A vote is scheduled no later than 4 weeks after initial introduction of the change.
A vote may be scheduled earlier if all committee members agree.
* The change is accepted if three-fourths of the committee members vote in favor.
* The pull request is merged or closed.
