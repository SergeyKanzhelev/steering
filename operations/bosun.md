# Steering Committee Bosun Guide  

This doc is a guide to help the delegated Steering Committee (SC) Member bosun
the public meeting. SC members will pick a new one for the next meeting at the
end.  

## Before / Prep for meeting 
1. Create the skeleton meeting agenda:
- copy the template on the meeting agenda 
- populate with: 
  - follow up items the meeting prior,
  - parking lot topics at the top, 
  - outreach to other steering and community members,
  - items that need votes and/or assignments  
2. Assign timeboxes. Guidance: anything not needing discussion should be 1 min
each - examples: voting, assigning. If it's a community member topic: ask. 
3. Post a call for final topics with draft agenda at least 3 business days with
a clear cut off to the following places as reminders:
  - leads@kubernetes.io, 
  - steering@kubernetes.io with instructions to read any supporting materials 
  ahead of time and come with discussion points/questions  
  - #chairs-and-techleads, #steering-committee, #kubernetes-contributors
Ideally this would be Wednesday before the meeting and closing the agenda by 
Friday to give time for everyone to prepare.  

## Day of Meeting 

1. Join ten minutes early to make sure all audio, video, and zoom
administration (including capability to record) is right. You'll need the zoom 
host key at the very least and to record to the cloud.  
2. Make sure that you have cleared your desktop and can be prepared to present
if needed. Sometimes AV problems will require you to step in and present.
### Starting:
1. Before recording the meeting, tell the group “This is a Kubernetes meeting
that will be posted publicly on YouTube, so please be mindful that what you say
is being recorded. Please also mute if you are not speaking.” 
2. Check on [quorum] and update the attendees with whats going on. We need 4 to
meet and 5 to vote. 
3. If the agenda has room, call on others to add topics and start recording.
4. Encourage Steering members to put [Steering] in front of their names and 
community members to do roll call on the agenda. 
#### After recording starts:
1. Hello! Welcome! [introduce yourself] This is the Kubernetes Steering
Committee [public/private] Meeting for [month/year].
2. Code of Conduct reminder with instructions.
  - DM you as bosun and/or conduct@kubernetes.io
3. Ask for a note-taker if you don't have one and for folks to raise hands when
they have discussion points or comments.
4. Discuss that we may ask for further context, docs, etc. so that we can better
 understand larger issues or items. If there is a case where we don’t have
 enough or not prepared, we will set up a separate meeting, bump to the mailing
 list for further conversation, or invite to another meeting.
#### Mid-meeting
1. Check on zoom chat to make sure voices are heard and acknowledged there.
2. Make sure Steering members who haven't had a chance to comment are given the
opportunity for each discussion topic. 
3. Adhere to timeboxes as much as possible.  
## Ending:
1. Pick the next bosun.  
2. Thank everyone for their time.  

## After a month of meetings (2):

- Clean up / format agenda 
- Set any issues and assign owners that arise
- Forward notes and announcement of next bosun to steering@kubernetes.io
