# Funding Requests

Need to pay for something on behalf of the Kubernetes Project? This is the
document to read. In general there are a few rough types of costs that can be
covered:

- Infrastructure: testing infra, video conferencing, mailing lists, domains, etc
- Events: SIG face-to-face meetings, developer summits, etc
- Consulting services: docs writers, security auditors, etc
- Community Gifts: swag codes, thank you cards, etc

## How to request funding

Open a funding request issue using the most appropriate funding request issue
template.

After filing an issue please expect to wait 1 week for approval and potentially
another week to a month for funding from the CNCF depending on the request size.

## SIG or Committee Approvals

Please provide links to show the appropriate approval process was followed by
including links to the relevant approvals (meeting minutes, e-mail thread, etc.)

## FAQ

**What happens behind the scenes?**

If the request is approved it will then go through the CNCF Service Desk
however only a small number of people from the project can directly make
requests.

**Who Pays for this stuff?**

The Kubernetes project relies on a number of paid services for day-to-day
operations; this includes Zoom for video calls, Google cloud for test
infrastructure, and Netlify for website deployments. Also, the project covers
one-off costs like space for developer summits to bring developers together or
swag incentivize and celebrate project successes. And these bills are paid for
by CNCF members via their membership fees and at times in-kind donations.
